# ECSE 316 DNS Client Assignment Report

## Design

We have decided to split our design into two top-level classes while trying to follow an OOP standard: **DnsPacket** and **Parser**. Error handling has implemented all throughout these classes and method. We also decided to use the `argparse` library and `socket` library to parse arguments coming from the CLI and establish a UDP socket connection with the DNS Servers (respectively).

### DNSPacket

The first class is DnsPacket and it contains sub-classes Header, Question, Answer, Authority, and Additional Information; All representing the components of a DnsPacket. All the subclasses contain their own string representations which help to construct their respective segments.
#### Header

The Header sub-class contains instance variables such as the ID, QDCOUNT, ANCOUNT, NSCOUNT, and ARCOUNT. Additionally, it contains another sub-class called Flags which is also used as an instance variable.
##### Flags

The Flags sub-class contains instance variables such as QR, Opcode, AA, TC, RD, RA, Z, RCODE. It contains and initializer method which helps to construct the Flags class and it also had a helper method called unpack which can be used to demarshal the flags of an incoming response DNS Packet.
### Question

The Question sub-class contains information about the question being asked in the DNS packet. In particular it contains the instance variables: QNAME, QTYPE, and QCLASS.
### Answer

The Answer sub-class contains information about the answer to the question in the DNS packet. It is not used so much in the construction of the DNS request packet but it contains helpful methods for the demarshalling of the DNS response packet.

### Authority

The Authority sub-class contains instance variables specific to the authority but nothing related to the construction of the authority section of a DNS packet because we are not implementing it in this assignment. Instead, it contains functions responsible for demarshaling the authority section of an incoming DNS response packet.
### Additional

Similar to the Authority sub-class it only contains methods and instance variables related to demarshaling a DNS response packet.

### Parser
The Parser class contains the initialization of the argument parser for the command line interface (CLI). The argument parser is responsible for parsing the arguments passed to the CLI and converting them into a format that can be used by your program. The Parser class provides the CLI with arguments such as domain names, IP addresses, query type, and more.

### Helper Functions

Additionally, there are some global helper functions that are used throughout the class so specifying at the top-level of the file is beneficial.

### Main

Lastly, we have our top-level main method which is responsible for wiring everything together. It is responsible for intializing a UDP connection to the DNS server of the users choice, construsting a DNS request packet using the appropriate arguments from the parser and DnsPacket class, sending that packet while also waiting for a response and demarshaling it.

## Testing

In order to test our implementation we utilized the `unittest` library. We wrote test cases related to the construction of DNS packets, marshalling and unmarshalling data, the destructuring of example DNS response packets, and response times of sending/receiving packets over a UDP socket.

## Experiment

> What are the IP addresses of McGillâ€™s DNS servers? Use the Google public DNS server (8.8.8.8) to perform a NS query for mcgill.ca and any subsequent follow-up queries that may be required. What response do you get? Does this match what you expected?


> Use your client to run DNS queries for 5 different website addresses, of your choice, in addition to www.google.com and www.amazon.com, for a total of seven addresses. Query the seven addresses using the Google public DNS server (8.8.8.8).

> Briefly explain what a DNS server does and how a query is carried out. Modern web browsers are designed to cache DNS records for a set amount of time. Explain how caching DNS records can speed up the process of resolving an IP address. You can draw a diagram to help clarify your answer.

The main responsibility of a DNS server is to resolve host names to ip addresses so user querries in the form of requests can be resolved. Moreover DNS is meant to act s a distributed database in which its servers (who implement an application-layer protocol) all contribute to the goal of name resolution.

Caching DNS records can limit the overhead placed on DNS servers and resolve user queries more quickly by limiting round trip time. Instead of a DNS Server('s) having to spend resources on resolving the request our browser can use a previously resolved request (for the same ip address) and do it for us.
